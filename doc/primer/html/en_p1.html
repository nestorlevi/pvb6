<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>
We present a Open Source process visualization, HMI and SCADA system. From the view of the user it works almost like a web browser. Because pvbrowser uses Qt it runs on many platforms. If you want to create a process visualization using pvbrowser you should be familiar with ANSI-C.
</p>
<p>
Many people think, that process visualizations can be created graphically. We think, this is correct for the layout and design of the masks that are displayed on screen. But programming the logic of a visualization is much more powerful and flexible.
</p>
<p>
Please note that many web pages are programmed using PHP. Thus programming is also used for creating web pages.
</p>
<p>
If you want to create a visualization with pvbrowser you have to create a pvserver. This is done using pvdevelop. Programming is relatively easy, because only simple ANSI-C features are used. But you are not limited to ANSI-C. You can also use C++ and any foreign library written in C/C++ from within pvserver.
