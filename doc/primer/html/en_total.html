<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>
We present a Open Source process visualization, HMI and SCADA system. From the view of the user it works almost like a web browser. Because pvbrowser uses Qt it runs on many platforms. If you want to create a process visualization using pvbrowser you should be familiar with ANSI-C.
</p>
<p>
Many people think, that process visualizations can be created graphically. We think, this is correct for the layout and design of the masks that are displayed on screen. But programming the logic of a visualization is much more powerful and flexible.
</p>
<p>
Please note that many web pages are programmed using PHP. Thus programming is also used for creating web pages.
</p>
<p>
If you want to create a visualization with pvbrowser you have to create a pvserver. This is done using pvdevelop. Programming is relatively easy, because only simple ANSI-C features are used. But you are not limited to ANSI-C. You can also use C++ and any foreign library written in C/C++ from within pvserver.
</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
The “ideal” process visualization would run in a standard web browser. In this case nothing had to be installed on the client computers, because web browsers are standard. Unfortunately web browsers have not been invented with process visualization in mind. In principle a web browser reads a HTML file from the webserver and displays it's content. Each time a HTML file is read the network connection is opened and closed. Dynamic changes in the content are difficult and inefficient.
</p>
<p>
A Java Applet might be a solution. Unfortunately complex Java Applets need a long time to load. Furthermore Java Applets are not famous for being fast.
We have build a new browser in C++, which is optimized for process visualization. Instead of HTML it dynamically handles Qt Widgets.
</p>
<p>
Because pvbrowser is a browser it can display any visualization. There is no need to update client computers running pvbrowser, when you change your visualization. This is in contrast to many process visualization systems which use the “fat client” model. Furthermore pvbrowser supports many platforms at the same time.
</p>
<p>
When you choose the URL of your pvserver from within pvbrowser a TCP network connection is opened. The network connection will stay open until you terminate the session with your pvserver. After opening the network connection pvserver will start sending commands to pvbrowser. Each command is a line of text which is terminated by a newline. pvbrowser will interpret the text and call the according functions from the Qt widget library. Thus pvserver handles the whole widget tree within the main window of pvbrowser. When the user triggers an event (e.g. hit a button), a line of text will be send from pvbrowser to pvserver. In pvserver there is an event loop, in which these events can be handled.
</p>
<p>
For programming pvserver we provide a library that encapsulates the lines of text send to pvbrowser. The reference for this library can be found under “pvslib” in the manual, which is also available from the online help of pdevelop.
</p>
<p>
A substantial part of pvserver is not written manually. Instead pdevelop will gently generate the code for you. The functions provided by the library can be inserted by choosing from a menu in pvdevelop.
</p>
<p>
The whole layout and design of the masks you are using in your visualization is made graphically using the integrated designer from pvdevelop. 
When you have further questions after reading this primer feel free to contact us at mailto:lehrig@t-online.de?subject=pvserver further questions .

<p>
Have fun using pvbrowser.
</p>
<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>
You can install from the pvb.tar.gz package. The source code, the executables and the libraries are included. 
</p>
<p>
Install with the following commands on Linux:
</p>
<div style='clear:left; background:#DEDEDE;'><pre>
“download” pvb.tar.gz
tar -zxf pvb.tar.gz
cd pvb
./clean.sh
./build.sh
su
./install.sh
exit
</pre></div>

<p>
Windows users can install from install-pvbrowser.exe available from our download page.
</p>
<p>
For Mac users there is a DMG with the pvbrowser client on our download page. If you need the complete development package build the project as described above.
</p>
<h1>Running demo</h1>
<p>
There is a demo pvserver included in the installation package. Change to the directory containing the demo and start the demo server.
</p>
<div style='clear:left; background:#DEDEDE;'><pre>
cd /opt/pvb/pvsexample
./pvsexample
</pre></div>

<p>
Within the console the demo pvserver prints the following:
Info: going to accept on port 5050
</p>
<p>
This means that the server is waiting for clients on it's default port 5050.
Currently the pvserver is started in foreground. Howto start pvserver in background will be explained later. The pvserver can be controlled with some options.
</p>
<div style='clear:left; background:#DEDEDE;'><pre>
lehrig@nb3lehrig:/opt/pvb/pvserver&#062; ./processview -h
ProcessViewServer 2.9 (C) by R. Lehrig 2000-2005       lehrig@t-online.de

usage: ProcessViewServer -port=5050 -sleep=500 -cd=/working/directory
default:
-port=5050
-sleep=500 milliseconds
-cd=/working/directory
</pre></div>

<h1>Running pvbrowser</h1>
<p>
After starting the demo pvserver you may start pvbrowser.
</p>
<p>
Linux:
</p>
<div style='clear:left; background:#DEDEDE;'><pre>
pvbrowser
</pre></div>

<p>
Windows:
</p>
<div style='clear:left; background:#DEDEDE;'><pre>
.\pvb\win-mingw\bin\pvbrowser.exe
</pre></div>

<p>
pvbrowser will connect to it's default pvserver at localhost. Within the window you see a simple demo visualization. The demo is mainly a periodic table of the available widgets. Please experiment around a little. Also look to 
“File-&#062;Options”. Here you can customize pvbrowser. Note that some changes under Options only take effect after restarting pvbrowser.
</p>
<h1>Using pvdevelop</h1>
<p>
pvdevelop is a IDE for developing pvservers. It relies on some external commands. These are:
</p>
<p>
Linux:
</p>
<div style='clear:left; background:#DEDEDE;'><pre>
qmake
g++
make
</pre></div>

<p>
Before using pvdevelop make sure these commands are available. You may have to install the qt development package first and link qmake to /usr/local/bin/
</p>
<p>
Windows:
</p>
<div style='clear:left; background:#DEDEDE;'><pre>
Qt including qmake
MinGW
</pre></div>

<p>
Before using pvdevelop make sure Qt and MinGW is installed. In the bin directory there are batch files you can edit in order to use these newer tools or even a different C++ compiler.
</p>
<h2>New visualization</h2>
<p>
Now start pvdevelop. Choose “File-&#062;New pvserver”. Within the dialog box choose a empty directory for your project. Per default the new project is called “pvs”. You may change this and click OK.
</p>
<p>
Now the designer from pvdevelop is shown and you can input your first screen mask. Start by clicking the right mouse button. You can switch from the designer edit mode to test mode by “release mouse” and “grab mouse”. In order to switch tabs of a TabWidget you also have to switch from edit mode to test mode.
</p>
<h2>Using the integrated designer</h2>
<p>
First you should set xGrid and yGrid under "File-&#062;Options".
This defines, in which steps you can graphically input widgets.
</p>
<p>
Within the designer you always use the popup menu on the right mouse button. Now you can insert the widgets you want to use. Some parameters of the widgets can be input in the “Properties” dialog.
</p>
<p>
When you are ready with the design of your mask save it to disk and switch back to the editor.
</p>
<p>
Now you can use “Action-&#062;StartServer” and then “Action-&#062;pvbrowser” to start your initial pvserver.
</p>
<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>
If you just have created a new visualization you will see the generated code within pvdevelop. Please browse the code and the project file. There is 1 project file, 1 main module, 1 headerfile and currently 1 mask. Try to understand the structure of the pvserver.
</p>
<p>
Most of the code is maintained by pvdevelop. Your task is to code the “slot”-functions.
</p>
<h3>Output to widgets</h3>
<p>
The reference for programming can be found at “Help-&#062;Manual-&#062;pvslib” within pvdevelop. All these functions have a “PARAM *p” as first parameter. In this structure pvserver holds some important information. The most important is p-&#062;s, which is the socket pvserver uses for communication with the client. Most of the provided functions will simply send a line of text terminated by newline to pvbrowser. pvbrowser will interpret this text and call the according Qt method.
</p>
<p>
Example:
</p>
<div style='clear:left; background:#DEDEDE;'><pre>
pvPrintf(p, label1, ”Hello world. This is call number %d”, call_number++);
</pre></div>

<p>
All widgets that you input in the designer are listed in the enum in your generated mask. Assume you have input a text label “label1”. Then you can print text to it as shown above. Most functions described in the reference manual work that way.
</p>
<p>
The most frequently used output functions can be inserted by selecting the “Widget Name” toolbox in pvdevelop and clicking on the according widget name id.
</p>
<h3>Event handling</h3>
<p>
Within the “Slots”, you can insert your code.
For example select the “Widget Name” toolbox, click at the button id and insert a BUTTON_EVENT.
</p>
<p>
In the above example we terminate the current mask and return to pvMain() in order to show a different mask.
</p>
<h3>Graphics</h3>
<p>
Graphics can be done using different methods. Please view “solutions” in our documentation at http://pvbrowser.org. You can simply copy&paste these solutions into your code and modify it to your needs.
</p>
<p>
Using “Draw/SVG” you can display XY-plots, simple line graphic and SVG graphics.
Using “QwtPlot” you can display more elaborate XY-plots.
</p>
<p>
You can also use external plot tools like GNUplot.
</p>
<p>
Bitmap pictures can be inserted using a “Image”, set set whatsThis=filename in the Property Editor pane.
</p>
<h3>Tables</h3>
<p>
Tables are a powerful means for displaying and editing tabular data. The data may come from physical interfaces or from database systems. The most simple method to output something to a table is.
</p>
<div style='clear:left; background:#DEDEDE;'><pre>
pvTablePrintf(p, table1, x, y, "this is the cell text");
</pre></div>

<p>
For more information view “Modules-&#062;construction-&#062;pvQTable” in the pvslib manual.
</p>
<h3>Assigning physical values</h3>
<p>
From within pvserver you can use any external library written in C/C++. Thus you may implement access to physical values. Such a library is rllib, written in C++. The necessary code for acessing modbus and siemens PLC's is already included in the generated code. In order to use it you only have to comment it out. Accessing modbus is shown below.
</p>
<div style='clear:left; background:#DEDEDE;'><pre>
val = modbus.readBit(offset,number);
</pre></div>

<p>
For more information view the online documentation.
</p>
<h1>Starting pvserver in background</h1>
<p>
Per default pvserver is a multithreaded server. For each client that connects to it a new thread is started. pvserver has to be started when your computer boots. Within the booklet this procedure is described for the different operating systems.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively you may start pvserver from xinetd. In this case you have to uncomment “DEFINES += USE_INETD” and use libpvsid.so instead of libpvsmt.so in the project file and recompile. 
</p>
<h1>pcontrol</h1>
<p>
pcontrol is a pvserver available as separate download. It provides an event log system and a means to start processes in background and to control them. Using pcontrol you can comfortably print event log messages from any of your processes in the network to a central instance. The operators can browser the event logs from within pvbrowser. Also you may start all other processes your automation is consisting of from pcontrol. This may be your pvservers, daemons for fieldbus access, soft PLC's or whatever. 
</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
You should now be familiar with the basic structure of pvserver development. For further reading view the manual and the booklet available from online help.
</p>
<p>
Within “solutions” in our documentation you may find interesting code sequences you may copy&paste into your code.
</p>
<p>
pvbrowser operates on widgets (buttons, labels, tables ...). The function for constructing such a widget is automatically generated for you by pvdevelop. The description of these constructors can be found under “Help-&#062;Manual-&#062;pvslib&#062;Modules-&#062;construction”. 
</p>
<p>
Please view this topic because you will find all functions that apply to a special widget there.
