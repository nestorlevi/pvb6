Hello,

my name is Rainer Lehrig.
I'm the initiator of pvbrowser
and now I'm the maintainer again.

My famous search string is "murx".
Actually i have used "rlmurx-was-here" to mark modifications.

One goal is small footprint and beeing able to build on robinson island
Therefore the minimum we need is a C++ compiler and an operating system.
Currently i use g++ and OpenSUSE Leap 15.4
Also some Raspians are in use. But only for pvserver tasks, so we may omit Qt and GUI tools.
Besides this there is an out of date Mac Book Pro (Intel) and some old and newer Windows systems.
I did not test OpenVMS for a longer period but i see no problems there.

This may come into conflict when building for binary packages for popular runtime environments like:
- OpenSUSE-Buildservice for Linux distries
- Homebrew
- MS Windows based systems

When building we have to choose if we want to use
- Webkit
- Blink (the Google fork of Webkit)
- Qt HTML support
and VTK is optional

The standard is currently:
- i build with Blink support on Linux/Windows
- i build with Webkit support on Mac (using the old now deprecated xcode C++ compiler)
- i build with Qt HTML support on Android
- i do not know if i can manage to build the GUI components on Raspbian


Thus building from source is essential in my Opinion.

Current state: 04 Mar 2023

Nothing new happend here within the last 3 years.
But the environment changed.
Because of this building pvbrowser produced more and more WARNINGS and so on.

Currently i work on the OpneSUSE buildservice in order to produce binary packages for the major linux distries.
Windows/Mac/Android versions can stay as is currently.

Now i introdueced the following new shell scripts:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 lehrig users 1020 11. Feb 08:55 rlbuild-rllib.sh

You may also use build.sh as before.

Please review the scripts.
Within we call "source rlsetup.sh" and "../qmake.sh" on the according qt-project-file.pro 
which is responsible for creating the according Makefile.

On the OpenSUSE Buildservice we currently have g++ and clang based distries.
With Raspian i currently have some problems building the GUI components.

* experimenting with lcms-devel on pvbrowser.spec
* experimenting with liblcms2-dev on debian.control

### The following packages were produced on the OpenSUSE Buildservice ###
