You'd like the scripts 'cif_load' and 'cif_unload' to be
executed automatically at system start and shut down?

-------------- Strategy for SuSe Distribution --------------
CIFdrv is an example script for automatic load and unload of
CIF device driver. It was created from /etc/init.d/skeleton
(SuSe package). For details see 'man 7 init.d'.

After you placed this script in /etc/init.d directory, you
must create a link to it in /sbin; with 'insserv' add it
to 'rcx.d'; add a line 'START_CIFDRV="yes" to /etc/rc.config.

Lines 34, 35 in the script file CIFdrv specify where
'cif_load' and 'cif_unload' are located.
	CIFDRV_LOAD=/usr/sbin/CIFDRV_LOAD	
	CIFDRV_UNLOAD=/usr/sbin/CIFDRV_UNLOAD

In this case /usr/sbin/CIFDRV_LOAD and .../CIFDRV_UNLOAD are 
links to /home/cif/cif-V2.000/src/cif_load and .../cif_unload 
on my computer. This can be changed if you like. 
In 'cif_load' I decided to give module file name (cif.o) for
'insmod' command with full path. If you don't like it, please 
see insmod manual on how to use MODPATH environment variable 
or the module configuration file /etc/modules.conf.

It seems to be very complicated, but isn't!
