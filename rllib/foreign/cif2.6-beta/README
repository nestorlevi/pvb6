         1. CIF Device Driver, Beta V2.600
Our CIF Device Driver in actual release V2.600 supports CIF-50 PCI, CIF-80
Compact-PCI and CIF-30/CIF-104 ISA cards. 
Actual developments are always to find on our Home Page www.Hilscher.com.

To build and load the driver module cif.ko  use driver_build_n_load.sh script
in the src/ directory, to simply load an already existing driver execute driver_load.sh 
script and to remove the driver and the corresponding device file execute
driver_remove.sh script in the same directory.
 
PCI cards are autodetected by driver. If you use ISA cards, you have to 
pass load parameters to the driver. 

         1.1 ISA boards
These parameters are: DPM-address, DPM-size and IRQ-number. you can have 
plugged up to four Hilscher communication Boards at a time, so you can 
pass up to four DPM-addresses, DPM-sizes and IRQ-numbers. The best way to 
describe this is by showing a few samples of the command line.

./driver_build_n_load dpm_add=0xCA000 dpm_len=0x2 irq=11 
  if there is only one ISA board plugged with appropriate jumper settings.
If you want the board to operate in polling mode simply pass IRQ-number 0:
./driver_build_n_load dpm_add=0xCA000 dpm_len=0x2 irq=0

./driver_build_n_load dpm_add=0xCA000,0xCB000,0xCC000,0xCD000 dpm_len=0x2,0x8,0x6,0x8 irq=11,9,12,14
    if there are four ISA boards plugged with appropriate jumper settings

Note: On Intel platforms, DPM-addresses for ISA boards are in range 
      640KB-1MB (0xA0000 to 0xFFFFF).
      Do not forget to tag IRQ-number, You are going to use for ISA card, 
      in BIOS as an ISA IRQ.

         1.2 PCI Interrupts
The driver is disabling interrups on PCI boards by default. If you like to
run them in interrupt mode, you have to activate pci interrupts during
driver load as follows:
./driver_build_n_load pci_irq=y

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

         2. Driver Setup and Test Program
The Driver test program was developed with GTK+ version 1.2.8. 
For GNU Library General Public License agreement and library itself refer 
to the www.gtk.org

CIF Driver Setup and Test Program can help You to understand how to call 
Driver Functions. API for Driver itself is linked to the application as 
an object file (cif_api.o), see Makefile in 'test/' subdirectory of 
intstallation directory.
 
You can modify CIF Driver Setup and Test Program for your own needs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      3. Console Demo
If you want to test our Driver not in X-Windows Environment, there is a
simple console demo program incuded in package.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      4. Changes

This version of the driver is based on V2.100 and ported for the Kernel 2.6.
The license have been changed (softened) to the GNU Lesser GPL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      5. Notes

a) The driver version 2.100 works under Kernel 2.4.0-2
b) The driver version 1.003 works under Kernel 2.2.10, 2.2.14, 2.2.16
   Anyway, by any problems contact us via email. For the Address see below.
c) If you'd like to load and unload cif driver automatically at system
   start and shut down, there are two possibilities:
   -1- (the convenient way) you add the scripts 'cif_load' and 'cif_unload'
       to the scripts for system control - see 'AUTO/' subdirectory;
   -2- (time-consuming)  you integrate the driver in your actual Kernel
       static or as a module.
