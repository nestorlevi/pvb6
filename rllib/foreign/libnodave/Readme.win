To build with windows:
1.  Get and install the free commandline tools from borland (www.borland.com).
2.  The Makefile is for LINUX. For Windows, you need the file MAKEFILE.MAK.
    Either remove the file Makefile or call make with -fMAKEFILE.MAK.
3.  Running make with no target will build statically used versions of the test 
    programs and libnodave.dll
4.  Running make with target "dynamic" builds dynamically linked versions of the test 
    programs and libnodave.dll.
