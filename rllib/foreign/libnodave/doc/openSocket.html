<H1>openSocket</H1>
An OS specific routine to establish a TCP/IP connection to a partner.
There are different implementations for LINUX and WIN32.
While the OS specific implementation of openSocket() is part of LIBNODAVE dynamic library,
you could use your own routine and copy the resulting file descriptor/handle to the
members of your <a href=daveOSserialType.html>_daveOSserialType</a> structure.
<pre>
    int openSocket(const int port, const char * peer);

<li>port is the port number for the TCP/IP protocol, usually 102.</li>
<li>peer is the IP address of the PLC/CP as a string, e.g. 192.168.0.3 .</li>
