The main purpose of this library is to read and write data from and to Siemens PLCs.
To do so, you will have to do some preparations to establish a connection to the PLC.

First, you need to configure a serial port of your computer or establish a TCP connection.
This connection is represented by the type _daveOSserialType, which contains file descriptors
in cas of Unix-like systems, handles in case of windows and what other systems supported in 
the future might use for this purpose.

use setport to initialize the members of a <a href=daveOSserialType.html>_daveOSserialType</a> to something representing
a configured serial connection:
<pre>
    fds.rfd=<a href=setport.html>setPort</a>(argv[adrPos],"38400",'O');
</pre>
for serial connections or:    
<pre>
    fds.rfd=<a href=openSocket.html>openSocket</a>(102, IPaddress_of_CP);
</pre>
for TCP connections.    
<pre>
    fds.wfd=fds.rfd;
</pre>
With the initialized _daveOSserialType, you will initialize a structure of type 
<a href=daveInterface.html>daveInterface</a>, 
representing the physical connection to a PLC or a network of PLCs (e.g. like MPI).
<pre>
    di =<a href=daveInterface.html>daveNewInterface</a>(fds, "IF1", localMPI, daveProtoXXX, daveSpeedYYY);
</pre>
With the resulting daveInterface structure, you need to initialize an adapter, if one is used:
<pre>    
    res =daveInitAdapter(di);
</pre>    
While currently only MPI-adapters really need this initialization procedure, it is save to use
daveInitAdapter() with any protocol type. If it has no meaning for the protocol used, it is
mapped to a dummy procedure that returns allways success.

After successfully initializing your adapter, you can retrieve a list of reachable partners
on an MPI network. The function takes the daveInterface structure and a pointer to a buffer
of sufficient length as arguments. It returns the real length of the list. If the partners cannot
be listed with the protocol used, it just returns a length of 0.
<pre>    
    listLength = daveListReachablePartners(di,buf1);
</pre>
After successfully initializing your adapter, you can establish a connection to certain PLC
on the network. To do so, you will first initialize a structure of 
type <a href=daveConnection.html>daveConnection</a>, 
representing the physical connection to a single PLC.
<pre>
    dc =daveNewConnection(di, MPI_address, Rack, Slot);
</pre>
With the resulting daveConnection structure, you need to really connect the PLC:
<pre>    
    res =daveConnectPLC(dc);
</pre>    
<H4>Exchanging values:</H4>
Once you have established a connection to your PLC, you can read and write values:
<pre>
    res=<a href=daveReadBytes.html>daveReadBytes</a>(dc, <a href=area.html>AREA</a>, area_Number, start_address, length, buffer);
</pre>
<pre>
    res=<a href=daveWriteBytes.html>daveWriteBytes</a>(dc, <a href=area.html>AREA</a>, area_Number, start_address, length, buffer);
</pre>
Usually, you will have to <a href=conversions.html>convert</a> byte sequences from and to the buffer
to use the data in your application.<br>
After you are done with your data exchanges, call:
<pre>
	daveDisconnectPLC(dc);
</pre>
To disconnect from the PLC and
<pre>
	daveDisconnectAdapter(di);
</pre>	
to disconnect from the Adapter.
Now close the serial or TCP/IP connection using the appropriate system calls for your OS.
