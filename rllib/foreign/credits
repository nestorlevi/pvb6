We use some foreign libraries which are very usefull.
These libraries are compatible to Linux/Unix/Windows.
We do this for convenience of the users of rllib.
These libraries are included in rllib as they are.
The users do not have to think about them.
The generators for the daemon processes will generate the appropriate calls.
