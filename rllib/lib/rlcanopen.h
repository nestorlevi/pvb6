/*!
 * \section intro Introduction to rlCANopen-API
 *  
 * The rlCANopen-Software represents a developer friendly interface for
 * Hilscher CANopen Mastercard users, which ensures a comfortable
 * access to CANopen nodes and also Linux and Win32 portability.
 *
 * Using the Server-Client-architecture a network-wide availability of
 * data is feasible.
